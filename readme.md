# spitballin
start simple, copy fire eblem, then extend to alterations
start with terminal grid, get to GUI later
square tiles
units are named and bluk moved, not alternate between ally and enemy
classes, weapon types, 
tile/turn based
primay class + seceondary/lesser class. 2nd gives ~half benefits. can only change 2nd, main is locked in.
stats level based on class and half*second. some may give 50% of a point, in that they gain 1 every 2 turn. but a mode where percent can be actualy probs rather than tracked
pc customization via skill/gear choice during level up
